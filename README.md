# Social-Media-Policy


Employee acceptable use of social media
While we here at Montreat College understand and realize the temptation to access social media sites. We want to make sure that our employees are fully aware that all activity done on the network will be monitored and stamped with a duration of how long the user was on it. While we do not prohibit the use of social media, those who are not a part of the social media team must follow these guidelines:
•	No inclusion of the logo or name of the company
•	No negative posts/publicity about the company and/or customers
•	No information about upcoming products or projects that have been discussed
•	No posts that contain private or classified information
•	All posts must be claimed as the individual’s own and not the company’s views
•	Comply with all other rules within the employee handbook
Failure to comply with these guidelines, will result in serious re-evaluation of one’s job and possible restrictions on their and others privileges on the internet. We will address this issue again, by annual security policy evaluation.
